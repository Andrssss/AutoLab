## Colono Picker â€“ Automated Laboratory Device

We are developing a *Colono Picker* machine, and we are responsible for both hardware and software development.  
The software handles three main functions: **hardware control**, **image processing**, and a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.  
The development is currently in progress.

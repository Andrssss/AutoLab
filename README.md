## Colono Picker – Automated Laboratory Device

We are developing a *Colono Picker* machine, and we are responsible for both hardware and software development.  
The software handles three main functions: **hardware control**, **image processing**, and a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.  
The development is currently in progress.

This diagram represents the overall system architecture. The Marlin firmware is uploaded to the microcontroller, which communicates with a computer via a serial port. On the computer side, a Python script handles the communication, sending and receiving commands over the serial connection. :
